    <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2016-03-28/newly-discovered-fossil-reveals-when-siberian-unicorns-last-roamed-the-earth?src=usn_fb" title="Unicorn" target="_blank"> A 2016 study</a> published in the American Journal of Applied Sciences about the find says researchers originally believed 
    the <strong>Siberian unicorn died</strong> out 350,000 years ago, 
    but the newly discovered skull puts the formerly mythical creature much closer to us on the timeline of existence. There is one down side to this exciting development: These unicorns arent the all-white, flowing mane beauties of legend instead scientists believe the animals looked more like rhinos, or pint-sized, one-horned woolly mammoths.</p>
